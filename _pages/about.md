I am currently a graduate student at Zhejiang University, born and raised in Lishui, Zhejiang, China. I am broadly interested in robotics, cybernetics, and intelligence, and am actively studying and conducting research in these fields.

I am expected to receive my Master's degree from Zhejiang University in March 2026. During my master's studies, I have had the fortune of conducting research in Fei Gao's group (formerly known as FAST-Lab) at the College of Control Science and Engineering, under the supervision of Professor Fei Gao. I am also a prospective PhD student who will be supervised by Professor Yi Ma at The University of Hong Kong and the University of California, Berkeley. Currently, I am now a visiting student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, working with Professor Jie Song.

I obtained my BSc from the College of Energy Engineering at Zhejiang University. As an undergraduate, I had the great fortune of being mentored by Professor Kuochih Chuang, whose guidance transformed my perspective on academia during a time when I struggled to find motivation in school.

My current research focuses on pursuing advanced (skill-level) manipulation dexterity of machines.  Previously, my colleagues and I achieved precise aggressive maneuvers in aerial robots beyond human’s capabilities in controlled settings.  By striving to endow machines with human-like manipulation autonomy (as it is unique for human), we may uncover the essential principles, boundaries, and perhaps even the very nature of what distinguishes—or unites—artificial and biological intelligence. (P.S. Although I am not currently researching foundational models, reinforcement learning, self-supervision learning, and certifiable optimization methods themselves, I am very interested in these interconnected fields.)

I enjoy socializing, making friends, and following soccer and table tennis matches (I played on my elementary school's soccer and table tennis teams earning provincial and municipal honors). I'm also interested in hip-hop culture, especially rap.

I am a graduate student at Zhejiang University, born in Lishui, Zhejiang, and broadly interested in Robotics, Cybernetics, and Intelligence.

I am expected to receive my Master's degree on Robotics in March 2026, working with Prof. Fei Gao. I am also a prospective PhD student under Prof. Yi Ma at The University of Hong Kong and University of California, Berkeley. Currently, I am a visiting student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with Prof. Jie Song.

I obtained my BSc from the College of Energy Engineering at Zhejiang University, mentored by Prof. Kuochih Chuang, who transformed my perspective on academia during a time when I hated school.

My current research focuses on advanced manipulation dexterity.  Previously, I have achieved precise aggressive maneuvers in aerial robots beyond human’s capabilities in controlled settings.  I hope to see human-like manipulation autonomy in machines (as it is unique to human now), understanding the rule, principles, and limitations of artificial and natural intelligence.  

I enjoy making friends and following soccer and table tennis matches. I'm also interested in hip-hop culture.

I am a graduate student at Zhejiang University, born and raised in Lishui, Zhejiang, China. I am broadly interested in robotics, cybernetics, and intelligence.

I am expected to receive my Master's degree on Robotics in March 2026, working with Prof. Fei Gao. I am also a prospective PhD student under Prof. Yi Ma at The University of Hong Kong and University of California, Berkeley. Currently, I am a visiting student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with Prof. Jie Song.

I obtained my BSc from the College of Energy Engineering at Zhejiang University, mentored by Prof. Kuochih Chuang, who transformed my perspective on academia during a time when I hated school.

My current research focuses on advanced (skill-level) manipulation dexterity of machines.  Previously, my colleagues and I achieved precise aggressive maneuvers in aerial robots beyond human’s capabilities in controlled settings.  I hope to see human-like manipulation autonomy in machines (as it is unique to human now), uncovering the rule, principles, and limitations that distinguish artificial and natural intelligence.  
(P.S. Although I am not currently researching foundational models, self-supervised learning, and certifiable optimization methods themselves, I am interested in these interconnected fields.)

I enjoy socializing, making friends, and following soccer and table tennis matches (I played on my elementary school's soccer and table tennis teams earning provincial and municipal honors). I'm also interested in hip-hop culture.
